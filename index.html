                 <h5>Last updated: March 2017</h5>

             <br/>
                 <h4>PRIVACY STATEMENT</h4>
<br/>
                 At SNKRUP, we are committed to your right to privacy. We collect personal information from

                 our customers in the regular course of doing business. We have developed this Privacy Policy to

                 explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
<br/>

                 <h4>SECTION 1 – CONSENT</h4>

                 When you provide us with your personal, financial and transaction information to complete a

                 Ticket purchase, we assume you consent to our collecting your personal information and using it

                 for that specific reason.

                 We may ask you to give your express consent, such as by checking a box to indicate your

                 consent to receive marketing communications in order to send you emails about new products

                 and provide updates on current and upcoming contests.

                 If you would like to withdraw your consent, you may do so by contacting us at

                 info@snkrup.com.

                 <br/>
                 <h4>SECTION 2 – INFORMATION COLLECTED</h4>

                 We will collect personal information from you, including contact information such as your name,

                 resident address, telephone number and email address, and financial and transaction information

                 such as number of tickets purchased, contests entered into, method of payment, amount paid, and

                 credit or debit card number.

                 We collect such information in order to complete a transaction with you and fulfill your request

                 for our Products and Services. We use this information to create your account, contact and

                 correspond with you about your purchases, respond to your inquiries, and monitor functions or

                 features of our Websites that you may use.

                 When you browse our Website, we automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP)

                 address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and

                 operating system.

                 We keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and to

                 meet any legal requirements.

        <br/>
                 <h4>SECTION 3– COOKIES</h4>

                 We may use cookies to store your individual preferences and system information. “Cookies” are

                 small electronic data files that websites can store on your computer for record keeping purposes.

                 Cookies may be used on our Website to tell us that you have visited our Website before, to limit

                 the number of times you have to enter a password, to offer personalized web page content and

                 information for your use, and to track your activity at the Website. The use of cookies is

                 standard in the Internet industry and many websites use them.

                 You may modify your browser’s settings to notify you whenever a website is going to deposit a

                 cookie on your computer’s hard drive or other storage media. The notification option generally

                 gives you the opportunity to decide whether to accept or refuse a cookie in each instance. You

                 can configure your browser to always disable cookies when cookies are being sent to your

                 computer, although this may affect your ability to shop on our Website or other websites.

    <br/>
                 <h4> SECTION 4 – PAYMENT AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h4>

                 Third-party provides used by us to process your payment will only collect, use and disclose your

                 information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

                 However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment transaction processors, have

                 their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for

                 your purchase-related transactions. For these providers, we recommend that you read their

                 privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be

                 handled by these providers.

                 You will not be redirected to a third-party website when purchasing Tickets from our Website

                 but the financial and transaction information you provide to us and to our third-party provider

                 when completing any purchase will be governed by our Website’s Terms and Conditions and our

                 Privacy Policy, and our third-party provider’s Privacy Policy.
<br>

                 <h4>                 SECTION 5 - CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>

                 We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes and clarifications will

                 take effect immediately upon their posting on the Website. If we make material changes to this

                 policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what

                 information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or

                 disclose it.
<br/>
                 <h4>SECTION 6 - QUESTIONS AND CONTACT INFORMATION</h4>

                 If you would like to access, correct, amend or delete any personal information we have about

                 you, register a complaint, or simply want more information, please contact us at
